## Purpose

I did this project as I started my Data Science emphasis in my Computers Science Degree. I got to practice using libraries, I learned how to manipulate and clean data, and I did my first project in Jupyter Notebook.

I also applied trained different models and learned how to compare their accuracy. The models I used were Support Vector Machine, Logisitic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors. For K-Nearest Neighbors, I also learned how to compare the accuracy of different values of n.

## Install

This project was built in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.9 and requires the following libraries:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html/)

## Data

The Palmer Penguin Data Set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/parulpandey/penguin-dataset-the-new-iris/data).

The raw data from `penguins_Iter.csv` can also be found in this repository as `./data/penguins_raw.csv`
